# Welcome to the METS-R SIM!

The METS-R SIM was initially developed for the project [Multi-modal Energy-optimal Trip Scheduling in Real-time](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1859675). Through extensive development, METS-R has evolved into a comprehensive road traffic simulator capable of scaling to large road networks. Similar to existing traffic simulators such as SUMO and VISSIM, METS-R employs car-following and lane-changing models to accurately simulate vehicle interactions, providing user-friendly online APIs for monitoring and manipulating vehicle and service behaviors.

Distinct from other simulators, METS-R Simulator uniquely:

1. Introduces a structured framework for shared mobility services, including ride-hailing and microtransit, driven by intelligent agents representing geographic zones, service requests, and detailed travel plans for vehicles and passengers.

2. Utilizes Kafka for real-time simulation of data streams generated by connected vehicles.

3. Integrates seamlessly with [Scenic](https://docs.scenic-lang.org/en/latest/language_reference.html) for sophisticated scenario generation and testing.
